    "\n",
    "# As a data scientist, the first step in any project is to collect relevant and structured data. \n",
    "# In this exercise, your task is to extract job-related information from the RemoteOK job website: https://remoteok.com/r\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives:\n",
    "# - Collect the following data fields for each job posting:\n",
    "#   - Company Name\n",
    "#   - Job Role\n",
    "#   - Location\n",
    "#   - Features or Tags (e.g., technologies, benefits, job type)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions:\n",
    "# - Use Python along with libraries such as requests, pandas, and optionally json or BeautifulSoup if needed.\n",
    "# - Retrieve the job data from the RemoteOK API or web page.\n",
    "# - Parse the JSON or HTML response to extract the required fields.\n",
    "# - Store the collected data in a structured format such as CSV for future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# A CSV file (e.g., remoteok_jobs.csv) containing all extracted job listings with the specified fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "# This dataset will serve as the foundation for further data analysis and machine learning tasks in upcoming lab exercises.\n",
